Use the `siang:humanize` skill (Skill tool, `skill: "siang:humanize"`) on `chat.md`. It is a LINE message a developer sends to a senior teammate (genre A, Thai with English tech terms). No writing sample is available.

Work through the skill's loop (draft, "still AI" bullets, final) in your turn, then make your final message the final rewrite only, verbatim, with nothing before or after it.

If the Skill tool reports the skill as unknown or unavailable, do the same humanize task yourself and still end with the final message described above.
